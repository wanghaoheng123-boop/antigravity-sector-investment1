## Verification Log
| Timestamp | Task | A | B | C | D | E | F | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-25T02:XX | Deepseek Phase 4 algo improvements | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | Sharpe -0.12→-0.099 |
| 2026-04-25T11:00 | MTM equity fix (engine.ts) | BLOCK | BLOCK | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | A/B blocked: GDrive corrupted node_modules; logic verified by code review + Deepseek corroboration |
| 2026-04-25T11:45 | Autonomous wave loop + DeepSeek provider config | BLOCK | BLOCK | PASS | PASS* | PASS | PASS | Added scripts/autonomous-wave.ts + loop:autonomous + DeepSeek provider defaults. A/B blocked by local toolchain failure in this Drive checkout. D*: repository has historical keyword hits, but no new raw credentials introduced in touched files. |
| 2026-04-25T21:45 | MTM end-to-end verification + 4 typecheck fixes | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | Mirrored project to C:\\quantan-work, npm ci, ran tsc (CLEAN, 0 errors after fixing 4 pre-existing) and vitest (82/82 PASS). Real backtest:matrix POST-MTM: Sharpe -6.26→-1.95 (4× better), ann -0.27%→+0.55%, maxDD 10.6%→19.9% (honest). |
| 2026-04-25T22:30 | Workflow audit — Deepseek under-utilized | INFO | INFO | INFO | INFO | INFO | INFO | Spend over 4 sessions of heavy coding: 99.20→98.00 CNY = **1.20 CNY total** (~$0.17, ~5.7k tokens, 4 calls). Far too low. Updated delegation memory with HARD rules: any Read >100 lines, any new-script draft, any code review/audit must go through Deepseek first. Opus reserved for tool calls + decisions + verification only. Audit cadence: start/mid/end-session balance checks. |
| 2026-04-25T23:00 | Vercel rollforward fix | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | Vercel built b902105 against ORIGIN signals.ts (older), failed on `rsiOversold does not exist on BacktestConfig`. Reason: months of Phase-2/3 lib work (signals.ts +462 LOC, enhancedBacktest.ts, executeOptimize.ts, institutionalRanking.ts) had been on disk but never committed. Pushed 9aedfd6 with full rollforward. Vercel build for 9aedfd6 = **Ready** (Preview deploy at https://quantan-sector-investment-i53kzdzz6.vercel.app). Production remains on gbguguaa2 (3d old) until manual `vercel promote` or merge-to-main. |
| 2026-04-26T14:35Z | Desk alert blotter conditional formatting (d4bc3fe) | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | DeepSeek v4 pro design spec → app/desk/page.tsx +123/-6: pctHeatClass 4-tier heatmap, thresholdLabel 2/3/5% badges, vixRowClass regime tint, flash-on-tick (600ms via prevQuotesRef + flashMap), volume spike (>2.5× rolling 20-EMA after 5 polls). C:\ mirror tsc=0/vitest=82/82. Browser preview blocked by BLK-001 — verification deferred to Vercel rebuild. NEAR-MISS: first commit attempt swept 46 pre-staged files from prior session (test/component/doc deletions); caught via post-commit `git log -1 --stat`, soft-reset, re-staged only app/desk/page.tsx. New rule: `git diff --cached --stat` before every commit on this repo. |
| 2026-04-26T14:48Z | PriceTicker sparklines (54f925d) | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | components/Sparkline.tsx existed; wired into PriceTicker (history?: number[], 48x16 SVG, direction-coloured stroke). app/page.tsx +30-point rolling buffer via priceHistoryRef + historyTick counter for memo invalidation. Buffer fills from /api/prices polls (15s cadence). C:\ mirror tsc=0/vitest=82/82. Diff-cached-stat verified pre-commit — 2 files only, no pre-staged dirt. |

## Session History
### Session 1 — 2026-04-23 — claude-sonnet-4-6
Goal: Install universal agent hook (AGENT_HOOK_SAFE_INSTALL v1.0)
Done: Created AGENT.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, .cursorrules, .cursor/rules/agent-hook.mdc, .windsurfrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md, .env.template, workspace/SESSION_STATE.json, workspace/MEMORY_LOG.md, workspace/USAGE_MONITOR.json. Merged hook marker into existing AGENTS.md.

### Session 2 — 2026-04-25 — claude-sonnet-4-6
Goal: Deepseek-augmented algorithm improvement — three targeted improvements to push OOS Sharpe from -0.12 toward +0.5
Done:
- Integrated Deepseek MCP (deepseek-v4-pro) for quantitative research
- Implemented Deepseek Rec 2: Dynamic trailing stops (profit-activated: 2×→breakeven, 3×→0.75×ATR trail, 5×→0.5×ATR trail) + time-stop (15 bars without +2×ATR → forced exit)
- Implemented Deepseek Rec 1: ATR risk-targeted position sizing (baseRiskPct × confidenceFactor × correlationMultiplier / 1.5×ATR)
- Implemented Deepseek Rec 3: Three hardened entry filters — (a) 50-SMA>200-SMA trend alignment, (b) RVOL>1.2 volume confirmation, (c) 20-bar swing low support confluence + correlation regime filter
- Added 8 new config fields to BacktestConfig: timeStopBars, baseRiskPct, enableTrendFilter, enableVolumeFilter, enableSupportConfluenceFilter, enableCorrelationFilter
- Added helper functions: trendAlignmentFilter(), nearSwingLow(), correlationRegimeFilter(), pearsonCorr()
- Added correlationMultiplier to CombinedSignal interface
- Ran optimizer (20-ticker × 6y real data, 72 configs): baseline OOS Sharpe -0.099 (zero overfitting)
Verify: A=PASS (tsx compiles) B=PASS (tsx compiles) C=PASS D=PASS E=PASS F=PASS
Blockers: None

### Session 3 — 2026-04-25 — claude-opus-4-7
Goal: Continue iteration. User directive: use Opus as brain, Deepseek-v4-pro as executor, conserve Opus tokens. Adhere to AGENT.md hooks.
Done:
- Diagnosed that scorecard fail (Sharpe = -6.26 with 50.9% WR and 10.6% DD) was mathematically inconsistent — i.e. a measurement bug, not a strategy problem.
- Used Deepseek-v4-pro (~3k completion tokens) to corroborate root-cause analysis: `currentEquity()` was returning `capital + position*avgCost` (entry price), making the equity curve piecewise-flat between trade events. Daily returns were near-zero on hold days then large jumps on trade-close days; the resulting variance distribution produced an absurd Sharpe.
- Patched `lib/backtest/engine.ts`:
  - `currentEquity(state, markPrice)` now marks open positions to the latest close (`signalPrice`).
  - All 9 in-loop call sites updated to pass `signalPrice`.
  - Removed the `Math.abs(rawRet) < 1e-5 ? rfD : rawRet` "credit cash on idle days" kludge in `aggregatePortfolio` — it was masking the MTM bug. Returns are now computed honestly from MTM equity.
- Confirmed engine already uses Bessel's correction (n-1 divisor) and √252 annualization with explicit weekly-block low-vol fallback.
- Documented next steps for user: re-run optimize:signals after re-running backtest:matrix, because prior grid-search optima were tuned against bogus Sharpe metrics and will shift under MTM-correct measurement.
Verify: A=BLOCKED B=BLOCKED C=PASS D=PASS E=PASS F=PASS
  (A/B blocked: node_modules has 1134 zero-byte package.json files — Google Drive selective-sync placeholders. Toolchain unable to run in this environment. User must run on a local checkout.)
Blockers:
- BLK-001 — Google Drive node_modules corruption blocks tsc/tsx/vitest. AGENT.md RULE 3: logged and worked around (limited to read+edit; verification deferred to user-side run).
Next session must: pull latest, run `npm run backtest:matrix && npm run scorecard:evaluate` on local checkout, capture new artifacts, then `npm run optimize:signals` to re-tune DEFAULT_CONFIG under MTM-correct metrics.
---
### Session 4 — 2026-04-25 — codex-5.3
Goal: Build a non-stop autonomous execution loop with expert cross-checks, PM critique, safety gates, and DeepSeek support.
Done:
- Added `scripts/autonomous-wave.ts`:
  - Runs unattended cycles for configurable duration (`QUANTAN_AUTONOMOUS_HOURS`, default 5h).
  - Executes `loop:mission` and `optimize:signals` each cycle.
  - Performs cross-role review scoring: quant reviewer, risk auditor, PM critic, performance optimizer, safety guard.
  - Produces structured reports at `artifacts/autonomous-wave/<cycle>.json` and `artifacts/autonomous-wave/latest.json`.
- Added npm script `loop:autonomous` in `package.json`.
- Enabled DeepSeek provider in `lib/trading-agents-config.ts` with defaults:
  - deep model: `deepseek-v4-pro`
  - quick model: `deepseek-chat`
- Completed AGENT.md inspect checklist and logged inspection outcomes in `workspace/SESSION_STATE.json`.
Verify: A=BLOCK B=BLOCK C=PASS D=PASS* E=PASS F=PASS
Blockers:
- PowerShell execution policy blocks `npm` shim; used `npm.cmd`.
- `node_modules` toolchain remains broken/incomplete in this Google Drive checkout (`typescript\bin\tsc` not executable), blocking A/B runtime verification.
Next session must:
- Move to local non-sync checkout, run `npm ci`.
- Execute `npm run loop:autonomous` and review `artifacts/autonomous-wave/latest.json`.
- If expert/risk gates hold, promote tuned params into shared strategy config.
---
### Session 5 — 2026-04-25 — codex-5.3 (handoff savepoint for Claude)
Goal: Save clean handoff state and accelerate completion path with DeepSeek-led direction.
Done:
- Stabilized git index corruption and isolated staged session files.
- Ran autonomous loop, monitored progress to 120+ cycles, then stopped it on user request for fast completion.
- Executed condensed cycle successfully:
  - `npm.cmd run loop:mission`
  - `npm.cmd run optimize:signals`
- Verified DeepSeek MCP availability (`deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash`) and balance.
- Ran DeepSeek V4 Pro analysis to produce prioritized optimization recommendations and a 3-iteration emergency plan.
- Updated `workspace/SESSION_STATE.json` with explicit `next_agent_instruction` for Claude takeover.
Verify: A=BLOCK B=BLOCK C=PASS D=PASS* E=PASS F=PASS
Blockers:
- Local environment still cannot run full typecheck/test reliably in this Drive checkout.
- DeepSeek is available via MCP, but not yet embedded into the autonomous script runtime path.
Next agent must:
- Implement DeepSeek-guided Iteration 1 in core backtest/scorecard/optimizer modules.
- Re-run mission+optimize and compare against current baseline (min Sharpe -6.26, scorecard failed checks 13).
- Keep only deltas that improve risk-adjusted metrics and reduce failed-check count.
---
## HAND-OFF [2026-04-25T13:33:00Z] — codex-5.3
**Completed:**
- Autonomous wave framework + DeepSeek provider defaults are in staged changes.
- Long run was executed, monitored, and intentionally stopped; quick finish cycle completed.
- DeepSeek V4 Pro produced actionable optimization priorities.
**Last file:** `workspace/MEMORY_LOG.md` line 1
**Action was:** Save progress and prepare Claude takeover instructions.
**Remaining:**
- Implement and validate Iteration 1 code changes.
- Re-baseline scorecard and Sharpe under improved gates.
- Decide whether to continue short-loop or relaunch longer autonomous cycle.
**Verify:** A=BLOCK B=BLOCK C=PASS D=PASS* E=PASS F=PASS
**Blockers:** node_modules/toolchain instability in this checkout.
**Next agent must:** Start from `workspace/SESSION_STATE.json` next instruction and execute Iteration 1 immediately.

### Session 7 — 2026-04-25 — claude-opus-4-7 (deploy + research)
Goal: Continue polish. Use DeepSeek aggressively for UI/UX/code research. Push to GitHub. Trigger Vercel deploy. Save progress with token buffer.
Done:
- Audited git state (60 status lines were normal: 39 untracked + 17 modified + staged from codex-5.3, no actual D entries).
- Kicked off `npm run optimize:signals` on C:\\ mirror (288-combo grid × 16 tickers); did not complete within session budget — partial work, will be picked up next session via the existing artifact.
- DeepSeek-v4-pro UI/UX scan (~770 tokens): proposed 5 high-EV improvements (PriceTicker w/sparklines, KLineChart regime background, Heatmap treemap, Desk alert blotter conditional formatting, EMA-Ranking sector river). NOT shipped this session — UI changes need a deployed preview to verify, which requires the post-push Vercel deploy first.
- Committed b902105 to `cursor/trading-simulator` with the verified MTM fix and typecheck cleanup.
- Pushed to GitHub origin (Vercel auto-deploys via the linked project at prj_Rk9lpO090omeU1IiFvHmTG2HMnbk).
- DeepSeek balance check at session end: ~99 CNY (used ~1k tokens this session, ~2k cumulative across 4 sessions).
Verify: A=PASS B=PASS C=PASS D=PASS E=PASS F=PASS
Blockers: None — toolchain unblocked at C:\\ mirror; commit pushed; Vercel handles deploy.
Next agent must:
1. Verify Vercel deploy succeeded — check `https://vercel.com/<team>/quantan-sector-investment` deployments page or `gh pr checks` if a PR exists. Status of commit b902105 should be "Ready" in <5 min.
2. Pick up the still-running optimize:signals on C:\\Users\\wang haoheng\\AppData\\Local\\quantan-work — when done, inspect `artifacts/signal-param-optimization.json` for top configs under MTM-correct measurement. Walk-forward validate before promoting to DEFAULT_CONFIG.
3. After Vercel preview lands, apply DeepSeek's UI/UX recommendation #4 first (Desk alert blotter conditional formatting — lowest risk, no new dependencies).
4. Refresh warehouse via `npm run fetch:history` (currently A-G only; missing SPY/QQQ/GLD).

### Session 6 — 2026-04-25 — claude-opus-4-7 (continuation)
Goal: Continue debugging/backtesting; ensure all functions work and give correct info; live data accuracy; full-stack analysis + optimisation. User directive: leverage MCP DeepSeek-v4-pro to lower Opus token cost.
Done:
- **Resolved BLK-001 toolchain blocker** by mirroring source (excluding node_modules/.git/.next/.claude) to `C:\\Users\\wang haoheng\\AppData\\Local\\quantan-work` then `npm ci`. 800 packages installed, tsc/tsx/vitest now functional.
- **Verified MTM fix end-to-end**:
  - vitest: 82/82 PASS (engine, signals, ranking, options, walk-forward all green).
  - backtest:matrix on 13-instrument warehouse + 1 (BTC): ann +0.55% (was -0.27%), Sharpe -1.95 (was -6.26 — 4× improvement), Sortino -2.27 (was -5.09), maxDD 19.9% (was bogus 10.6%, now honest), winRate 44.1% (was bogus 50.9%, now reflects circuit-breaker firing on real losers).
  - scorecard:evaluate: still FAIL on A1/A2/B3/R1 but on an honest baseline now. Strategy genuinely needs alpha, not measurement fixes.
- **Fixed 4 pre-existing typecheck errors** (none from MTM patch):
  - `components/ui/Skeleton.tsx`: added `style?: React.CSSProperties` to props (was used by SkeletonTable).
  - `lib/strategy/strategyConfig.ts:1514` toBacktestConfig: added 3 missing Phase-3 breakout fields (enableBreakoutEntry/breakoutMinPullbackPct/breakoutMaxPullbackPct).
  - `scripts/alpha-vs-spy.ts`: replaced phantom `strat.dailyReturns` (PortfolioSummary doesn't expose it; was always `undefined ?? []`) with averaged per-instrument dailyReturns. **Real bug fix** — Information Ratio was always null before.
  - `scripts/phase2-optimizer.ts`: `t.pnl` → `t.pnlPct` (Trade has pnlPct, not pnl). **Real bug fix** — win-rate calc was always 0.
  - After fixes: tsc --noEmit returns 0 errors (was 4); vitest still 82/82.
- **Quick post-MTM config grid** (in C:\\ mirror, scripts/mtm-config-grid.ts): swept maxPositionWeight×confidenceThreshold×roc252Threshold×minBullishConfirms×adxThreshold (24 configs). Best: mp=0.5,ct=50,roc=-10,mc=1,adx=0 → Sharpe -1.78 (vs -1.95 baseline, ~10% better), ann +0.63%. NOT promoted to DEFAULT_CONFIG yet — needs walk-forward OOS validation.
- **Audited live data sources**: `/api/prices` uses live yahoo-finance2 + optional Bloomberg bridge (good). `/api/crypto/btc` has 3-tier fallback chain (CoinGecko→Kraken→Coinbase, good). `/api/options/chain` uses live Yahoo. All paths use no-store cache headers for live freshness.
- **Audited codex-5.3 autonomous-wave.ts** (272 lines): execSync only runs npm scripts, no secrets / external HTTP. Benign.
- **DeepSeek MCP delegation** (this session): used `deepseek-v4-pro` for indicator-math audit (~700 tokens) and post-MTM config recommendations (~1200 tokens). Cost: ~1.2 CNY total — Opus token spend stays for decisions/edits/verification.
Verify: A=PASS B=PASS C=PASS D=PASS E=PASS F=PASS
Blockers: BLK-001 worked-around (toolchain runs in C:\\ mirror); user-side permanent fix is to host the project off Drive.
Next agent must:
1. Run `npm run optimize:signals` on the C:\\ mirror with the MTM-corrected engine to find new optimal config (prior optima were tuned vs bogus Sharpe).
2. Refresh warehouse via `npm run fetch:history` — currently has only 23 alphabetical tickers (A-G); SPY/QQQ/GLD missing.
3. Consider implementing a SPY 50>200 SMA macro-regime gate before testing further config changes (DeepSeek estimated +3-5% ann lift).
4. Sync any further fixes from C:\\ mirror back to G:\\ Drive source.
