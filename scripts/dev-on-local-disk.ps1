.SYNOPSIS
  Work around Google Drive / OneDrive npm failures (TAR_ENTRY_ERROR, EBADF).

.DESCRIPTION
  Clones this repo to a path on a local drive (default E:\), runs npm install with
  cache on that drive, then typecheck + tests + benchmark:optimizer.

  Usage (from repo root, or pass -SourceRepo):
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev-on-local-disk.ps1

  After a successful run, if package-lock.json changed, copy it back to your
  synced workspace and commit so Vercel `npm ci` can work again.
